# Phone Price Data Analysis

Fun project to help me buy a new phone. This project is focused on scraping and analyzing phone price data. It includes scripts for sequential and parallel data scraping, enabling efficient data collection.

This project contains two main scripts for scraping phone price data:
- `scrape.py`: Scrapes phone data sequentially.
- `scrape_parallel.py`: Scrapes phone data using multiprocessing for improved performance.
- `Data Cleaning And Exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for cleaning and exploring the scraped data.
- (Coming) : Build ML models to predict phone price based on its specs.
